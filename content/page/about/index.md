I am a lecturer, senior research associate, manager of the research center for applied computer science, and research associate for hessian.ai at the Darmstadt University of Applied Sciences. Recently, I received a Ph.D. degree in computer sciences for successfully defending my doctoral thesis about context-aware fault diagnosis in smart manufacturing. My research focuses on AI-based fault diagnosis in cyber-physical systems in Industry 4.0/5.0 smart factories. Moreover, I serve as a reviewer for Big Data Research, IEEE Information Visualisation (also as a PC Member), the International Conference on Industry 4.0 and Smart Manufacturing, and others with my expertise. I contributed international articles and book chapters on artificial intelligence, machine learning, visual analytics, and outlier detection to support the human-in-the-loop in industry-related fault diagnosis. A personal guiding scheme for my research is that a professional is a valuable source of expertise and should be supported to be able to excel in the new processes under Industry 4.0/5.0.
